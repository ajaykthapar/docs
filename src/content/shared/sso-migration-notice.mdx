<Tip>

If your organization's SSO was setup before April 2024 according to the [legacy setup ](#legacy-setup) instructions, Apollo recommends creating a new SSO configuration with the [updated instructions](#setup).

Once the new configuration is live, organization members will need to re-login to GraphOS Studio. Remove any legacy SSO configurations once you've confirmed the new configuration works as expected.

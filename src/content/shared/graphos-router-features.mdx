[The Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/) supports a collection of premium features specific to GraphOS. These include:

- **Real-time updates** via [GraphQL subscriptions](/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/)
- **Authentication of inbound requests** via [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/router/configuration/authn-jwt/)
- [**Authorization** of specific fields and types](/router/configuration/authorization) through the [`@requiresScopes`](/router/configuration/authorization#requiresscopes), [`@authenticated`](/router/configuration/authorization#authenticated), and [`@policy`](/router/configuration/authorization#policy) directives
- Incremental migration between subgraphs through [the progressive `@override` directive](/federation/entities-advanced/#incremental-migration-with-progressive-override).
- Redis-backed [**distributed caching** of query plans and persisted queries](/router/configuration/distributed-caching/)
- **Custom request handling** in any language via [external coprocessing](/router/customizations/coprocessor/)
- **Mitigation of potentially malicious requests** via [operation limits](/router/configuration/operation-limits) and [safelisting](../operations/persisted-queries/)

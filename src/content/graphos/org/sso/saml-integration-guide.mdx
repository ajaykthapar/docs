title: Setting up Apollo SSO with a SAML-based IdP
---

<PremiumFeature>

Single sign-on (SSO) is available only for [Dedicated and Enterprise plans](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#security).
This feature is not available as part of an [Enterprise trial](../plans/#enterprise-trials).

</PremiumFeature>

<SSOPreviewNotice />

This guide walks through configuring a generic SAML-based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo single sign-on (SSO). These steps require administrative access to your IdP.

<Note>

If you use Okta or Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) as your identity provider, instead see the corresponding guide for your tool:

- [Okta](./okta-integration-guide/)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](./microsoft-entra-id-integration-guide/)

</Note>

## Setup

1. Send your Apollo contact your IdP SAML XML metadata file. If you can't send this file, send one of the following instead:

   - IdP entity ID
   - IdP single sign-on URL / SSO URL
   - IdP x509 certificate

2. Your Apollo contact will respond with a URL to download Apollo's service provider (SP) SAML XML metadata file.

3. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: Apollo GraphOS
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

4. If your IdP permits it, upload the Apollo-provided SP SAML XML metadata file. Otherwise, open the XML metadata file and view the SAML configuration settings and manually enter them in your IdP.

5. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

6. Save your configuration once done.

7. Assign users to the Apollo GraphOS application.

   - Reach out to your SSO or Identity & Access Management team for help assigning the relevant groups and users to `Apollo GraphOS`.

## Legacy setup

1. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

2. If possible, upload the appropriate Apollo SAML metadata for your organization:

   - If your organization does not already use the Entity ID `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml)
   - If your organization does already use `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml)

3. Set your **Single Sign on URL** or **ACS URL** to the following:

   `https://sso.connect.pingidentity.com/sso/sp/ACS.saml2`

   You can also use this value for the following fields:

   - **Recipient**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL**

4. Set your **Entity ID** according to the following:

   - If your organization does not already use `PingConnect` as an Entity ID, use `PingConnect`.
   - If your organization does already use `PingConnect`, use the following value:
     `fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

5. Set your **RelayState** to the following value:

   `https://pingone.com/1.0/fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

6. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

7. Assign users to the Apollo GraphOS application.

   - Reach out to your SSO or Identity & Access Management team for help assigning the relevant groups and users to `Apollo GraphOS`.

8. Send your Apollo contact your identity provider (IdP) SAML XML metadata file.

   If you can't send this file, send one of the following instead:

   - IdP entity ID
   - IdP single sign-on URL / SSO URL
   - IdP x509 certificate

9. Your Apollo contact will complete your SSO setup.

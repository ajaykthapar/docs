This guide walks through configuring SAML- or OIDC-based single sign-on (SSO) for an Apollo organization. These steps require:

- Administrative access to your identity provider (IdP)
- The [**Org admin** role](../members#organization-wide-member-roles) in GraphOS

If you want to [multiple organizations](./multi-org) to share the same SSO configuration, repeat the steps for each organization.

## Configuration

1.  In [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content), go to the organization **Settings** page accessible from the top navigation.

    <Note>
      You must be on an organization page, not a specific graph's page to access
      these settings.
    </Note>

2.  Configure the email domains that will be associated with the SSO connection. [Details to-do].
3.  Follow the SAML- or OIDC-specific steps below.

    <Tabs labels={['SAML','OIDC']}>

     <Tab label="SAML">

    To-do

     </Tab>

     <Tab label="OIDC">

    To-do

     </Tab>

    </Tabs>

4.  Test your configuration by [To-do].
5.  Once you've confirmed you can access the organization via the SSO you configured, click **to-do**.

    <Note>

    Clicking **to-do** removes all organization members who have not yet logged in via the new SSO connection. To recreate their accounts, they need to login via SSO from `https://studio.apollographql.com/login`.
